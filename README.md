# Alternate mapping for Launchpad 🐴

**insert build not needed logo here**

there is already [a Launchpad mapping](https://github.com/szdavid92/mixxx-launchpad) on GitHub and another that comes with Mixxx. however, I felt neither of these fit my use-cases:

* the Mixxx built-in mapping:

  - is scrambled on my Launchpad. it's unusable.

  - heck, it even fails with errors.

* szdavid92's mapping:

  - the tall layout only has 4 hotcue buttons. come ON, IT'S 2018 and Mixxx is the only software that still prefers 4 hotcues over 8! almost every single DJ software has 8 hotcues today.

  - the juggler layout has a non-functional slip button and lacks the cue button.

  - i thought the sampler layout was for triggering the samplers? no, it's for triggering HOT CUES in the samplers instead.

  - oh, and you can only control 4 samplers. again, come on, it's 2018 and almost every single software today has at least 6 samplers! (serato has 8, rekordbox has 16, traktor and [my lackluster pads app](https://github.com/tildearrow/goodtimes/tree/master/programs/pads) has 64, VirtualDJ has infinite, and so on) until 2.1, Mixxx always had 4 visible samplers, and you decided to follow them 🙁

  - yes, i know i can just edit the mapping, but I don't wanna install a full-blown node environment just to build a script...

so I decided to write my own mapping from scratch, and here it is.

## features and nuisances

- designed for use only with 1 launchpad.

- designed for Mixxx 2.1.

- no build system.

- is inflexible, except for the middle pads, which will be described soon.

- 16 pad modes per deck.

- crossfader at the top. i don't mind clumsiness.

- no emoji in every single place. i'm a pretty bland person at times.

## HURRY UP and tell ME how to use it already!!!

sorry. you can clone/download-as-ZIP this repo, and then follow [these instructions](https://www.mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/controlling_mixxx.html#installing-a-preset-from-the-forum) (ignore the forum part... I doubt I'll post this there).

but I can't really hurry up since I must tell you how to actually use it...
